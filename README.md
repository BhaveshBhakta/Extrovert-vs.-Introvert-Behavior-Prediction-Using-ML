## üë§ Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior Prediction

### üìå Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether an individual exhibits **extroverted or introverted behavior** based on various features such as time spent alone, social event attendance, friends circle size, and post frequency. The goal is to provide insights into personality traits based on observable behaviors.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights

  * **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshkapilavai/extrovert-vs-introvert-behavior-data)
  * **Size**: 2900 entries, 8 columns (after initial loading)
  * **Key Features**:
      * Time\_spent\_Alone, Stage\_fear, Social\_event\_attendance, Going\_outside, Drained\_after\_socializing, Friends\_circle\_size, Post\_frequency
  * **Approach**:
      * Data Cleaning (Handling Missing Values, Dropping Duplicates)
      * Exploratory Data Analysis (Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps)
      * Label Encoding for Categorical Features
      * Binary Classification (Extrovert: `1`, Introvert: `0` - *assuming this mapping after encoding*)
      * Models Used:
          * Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Decision Tree
  * **Best Accuracy**:
      * $\\sim$93% with Gradient Boosting and SVC
      * $\\sim$92% with Logistic Regression and AdaBoost
